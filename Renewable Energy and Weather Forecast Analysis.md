# Renewable Energy and Weather Conditions
This data set contains informetion about the energy uses and the potential of different renewable sources in that Geographical area. We will consider this geographical area as a country. It should be clear that energy delta is not the energy used it is the difference between the energy used between 2 consecutive reading. 
Note (GHI - Global Horizontal irradiation)
# AIM
1. We will analyze the relation between the energy uses with different parameters
2. we will find the peak hour of energy use
3. we will analyze the effect of different parameters on energy delta
4. Finaly we  will try to find a reliable renewable energy source.
# Find the relation between energy consuption and other environmental factors.
Here we try to find relation between different environmental factor such as temperature, rain etc. 
!['Relation Between Temperature and Energy Delta over Time'](./Chart/Relation%20Between%20Temperature%20and%20Energy%20Delta%20over%20Time.png)
we also find out the energy consuption over the time perod which provide us significant informetion about the nature of energy uses in that region.
!['consuption Over Time'](./Chart/consuption%20Over%20Time.png)
As it is very important to find the peak hour for energy consuption and the months where demand of energy is more.

!['Mean of Energy delta[Wh] for Each Hour'](./Chart/Mean%20of%20Energy%20delta%5BWh%5D%20for%20Each%20Hour.png)

!['Mean of Energy delta[Wh] for Each Month'](./Chart/Mean%20of%20Energy%20delta%5BWh%5D%20for%20Each%20Month.png)

From the above expression we found out that there is a strong relaton between Temperature and energy  consuption.
Corelation between values.

# Finding a Reliable Source of Energy to Fullfill The Demand During The Peak Hour
Here we have 3 options
1. Solar Energy 
2. Hydro Electic 
3. Wind Energy 
We need to find out which is the most reliable source of energy for the given country (on the basis of its geography and climatic condition)
# Solar Energy
Here we analyze different environment factor which influance the solar energy production such as cloud coverage, snow, GHI.
